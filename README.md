# animation

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

✈️ This Flutter project demonstrates the use of the AnimatedAlign widget to smoothly animate an icon's position change from the bottom to the top of the screen. When the "Take off?" button is pressed, the airplane icon transitions from the bottom to the top center over a duration of 2 seconds, creating a visually appealing effect. The AnimatedAlign widget is perfect for handling such smooth position changes with ease.✈️
